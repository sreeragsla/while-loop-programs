1.controller will take 1 and check whether 1 is lesser than 26 and 1%2 equals to 0 or
  not.it is not equal so condition does not satisfies and incremation will happen
  and i will become 2
2.it will take 2 and check whether 2 is lesser than 26 and 2%2 equals to 0 or not.it is
  equal so condition satisfies and printing 2.incremation will happen and i will become 3
