1.controller will take 1 and check whether 1 is lesser than 4.1 is lesser than 4
  so condition satisfies and 1 will be multiplied with factorial and multiplied
  value will be stored in factorial.incremation will happen and i will become 2
2.it will take 2 and check whether 2 is lesser than 4.2 is lesser than 4 so
  condition satisfies and 2 will be multiplied with factorial and multiplied
  value will be stored in factorial.incremation will happen and i will become 3
3.it will take 3 and check whether 3 is lesser than 4.3 is lesser than 4 so
  condition satisfies and 3 will be multiplied with factorial and multiplied
  value will be stored in factorial.incremation will happen and i will become 4
4.it will take 4 and check whether 1 is lesser than 4.4 is not lesser so condition
  does not satisfies and controller will come out of the loop and printing factorial
